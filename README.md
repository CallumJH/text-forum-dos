# Planning

## Rough Notes

We're making a simple chat / forum app here. 
I would love to go big picture with it but lets get the basics working. 

- [ ] Use DDD?
  - [ ] Use CQRS?
  - [ ] Use MediatR?
  - [ ] Use FluentValidation?
  - [ ] Use AutoMapper? ( Not sure about this one )
- [ ] Use Serilog?
- [ ] Use TDD?
  - [ ] Use FluentAssertions?
  - [ ] Use xUnit
- [ ] Think About Frontend ( Depends on how far I get )
  - [ ] Otherwise postman / swagger


## Requirement Checklists

- [ ] dotnet project
